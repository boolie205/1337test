My experiences have been quite varied, from creating games to full blown web-based intranet platforms.\nBecause of this variation and these experiences I’ve found that I’ve acquired a thirst for front-end development and anything web related, which can range from mobile apps to web-based SaaS solutions. The fact that you can create ANYTHING with almost nothing is an exhilarating feeling. It’s one of the major reasons that keeps me going; the only limit is my imagination.\nI absolutely love to travel and experience new cultures (and food!) when the opportunity presents itself.

Yes, this passion that I am talking about is like an engine inside me that would work without fuel, something infinite, only for one reason and that is I love what I do.\n I have always believed that Front-end development is a thing that I would love, because it always brings me some fresh challenges to think about, makes me use all my effort and thought in order to provide a better solution.Thinking about the years that have passed by so far - deep diving in heart of the front end technologies and finding out about all it’s nuts and bolts and filling out my days and nights with it - brings a smile to my face. This smile is because I can look at myself and know that I've been enjoying some of the best times of my life, and I’m really glad that I've chosen the right thing for rest of it.\nTech life aside, in my spare time I always love to go biking, hiking, and love to walk or run. I’m not good at cooking but I actually love the experience of cooking when there are no options left (only for survival purpose).

Good or bad, I find ways to enhance my understanding of myself, my surroundings and of people. Later on in life, I learned to channel this and found myself in a leadership role in a company that works for people and with people in distress, and here I found something that felt right. A role that was ever-changing and evolving, a role where you get challenged every day and foremost get to learn stuff and at the same time get to support and help your colleagues in their respective quests. I have been on this track for a decade now and not regretted a second of it, and now I can finally make sense of it to my kid: \"well son, Daddy is a ninja\" and my son replies \"wauu that's so cool Daddy, I want to be a ninja too, like kung-fu panda\".

They were about HTML, and even one post was about the then just invented language Javascript. I was about 12 or 13 and the Internet had started to gain mainstream momentum. The dot-com bubble was building up. It would burst in March 2000, and I would give up on programming long before that, I just didn't know that while writing those posts.\nIt felt like I had to wait a million years to get computer access at home. To stand the waiting, I started collecting computer magazines, bringing the attached floppies and later CD-ROM's over to friends with computers to see what they contained. These magazines also used to provide simple guides on various topics, one of those happened to be HTML. I had to memorize the tags so that I could test them out by entering them in notepad.exe on the demo systems at my local Lap Power dealership.\nI was 11 when I got my hands on a screaming fast multi media monster (Pentium MMX) at home, a year later, a Telia 020 dialup connection completed the setup. It gave me everything I ever wished for. At this point, I knew very well how to abuse the <marquee> HTML tag and quickly managed to set up Geocities hosting.</marquee>\nThe Internet was very different back then. It provided me with a safe space during my years in secondary school. I even OP'd a successful channel on DALnet during those years. I never really got the hang of how the Perl scripts on Matt's Script Archive worked or what Dim meant in Visual Basic. I wanted to, but my interest had already started to shift to movie making.\nIn my later teens, I tried my best preparing for a career in film making. It proved to be difficult, being based in a small town far away from the industry didn't exactly help. To me, it made little sense to move just to Stockholm. If relocation was going to be required, why not move even further away. That's how I ended up in the Netherlands and how I began my exploration of north-west Europe. Brussels, Belgium was to follow, and before finally ending up in Stockholm, I spent ten years in Hamburg, Germany.\nI think it was in the Netherlands that I got my first VPS, I was a bit afraid at first, as it didn't come with a full-blown desktop environment that I had come to expect from my time using Red Hat Linux 5.2 (not REHL, much older). I slowly started to figure out how the command line worked, and with time people would actually pay me to do system administration for them. One thing bothered me, though, while I was confident in configure and run applications, I could still not fully understand how something was working by reading its source code.\nAfter doing Sysadmin, I developed a passion for programming. I remember, for years, all I did was study programming. I lived and breathed programming. I didn't even follow the news during these years, it's as if they didn't exist.\nI now work as a Devops, making good use of the experiences that led me to this position.","imagePortraitUrl":"https://i.1337co.de/profile/daniel-waardal-medium","imageFullUrl":"https://i.1337co.de/wallofleet/daniel-waardal-medium"},{"id":57,"name":"Daniel Wallin","city":"Lund","country":"🇸🇪","text":"I've always been driven by the desire to study how things work and fit together, from the smallest building blocks to how they connect together and build larger systems.

I have always loved playing construction sets and engineering toys. There were always not enough components to build something special, something out of the box. As a schoolboy, I read all the books in my local library about the technical details of steam engines, airplanes, rockets, robots, and more. When I was in 6th grade, I discovered a missing component. It was a computer. I immediately realized how valuable computers can be in my passion for invention. \nI decided to learn as much as possible about computers and programming.Thanks to my parents, they very soon noticed my craving for computers. They bought me a 48K ZX Spectrum, then an i486, then a Celeron. I started learning programming with Basic, Asm, Pascal, then switched to C/C++. I spent nights disassembling and reverse engineering applications and video games in attempt to figure out how they were made.\nTime has passed, I still have the same kid-ish curiosity and the same desire to explore and learn new things and make something special.These are still my main driving forces. When I find something attractive, I lose track of time digging into it down to its roots.\nAt the beginning of my IT career, I was a game developer. I have dealt with all aspects of the game development industry such as graphics design, sound design, level design, game features design, and of course programming, scripting, and testing. \nI have learned a lot and got an unforgettable experience working for 8 years in the game industry.In 2009, I decided to shift the focus of my career to software development, I was looking for something related to the Internet.Then I discovered an endless ocean of different technology stacks and approaches in web application development.Now I am a full-stack developer. I prefer to work on the server-side. I can work with .NET and NodeJS stack. In terms of frontend development, I have experience writing applications using React and pure JavaScript. \nI would like to advance my knowledge and skills towards system design, microservices, cloud solutions, high loads, and especially in the direction of web application security.I am eager to master new tools and technologies and apply them in practice. I firmly believe if one wants to be competitive, they need to constantly learn.I find pleasure in preventing and solving complex problems. I love the feeling when I see the results of work done that are useful for people or companies. When a new version that you have been developing for long time goes live and it works as expected, this brings unforgettable satisfaction with what has been done.I really appreciate the opportunity to be a member of the leet family at Tretton37.\n I look forward to expanding and applying my experience, as well as my ambitions and potential, to help companies meet their business needs. I am delighted to meet and work with all these talented creative people, who share the same mindset as me.\nI like spending my spare time with my family and friends. When I need to unload my brain and temporarily get rid of the thought of projects and work, I prefer to re-energize in nature. Traveling, hiking, cycling, and sailing help me quite well. I like many different outdoor and indoor activities. I am always open to trying something new. I like playing board games as well as video games. I play chess.","imagePortraitUrl":"https://i.1337co.de/profile/igor-antipin-medium","imageFullUrl":"https://i.1337co.de/wallofleet/igor-antipin-medium"},{"id":105,"name":"Ingemar Parra","city":"Stockholm","country":"🇸🇪","text":"Since I was a kid I was curious about computers...at least on the TV, they seemed to know it all.As I grew up and got my first PC and I found out that it knew very few things and that there were morequestions than available answers.

I loved the first few yeas, when I was still learning the tools of the trade, but eventually it all became a bit routine and finally I became bored. I wanted to keep learning. (Spoiler: I am still a craftsman)\nAfter some travelling and soul searching, I began studying at University. I studied maths, finance and business management, but also computer science.

However, the big difference was that the learning possibilities here seemed endless… and as it turns out, they are endless.\nWhile studying, I started a business together with three friends, and we made websites for a number of clients during our student years. When my friends left for careers in other industries I continued running the business on my own. It was a big challenge to have to take care of the whole business alone; from designing to coding frontend and backend - not to mention sales.

Pretty quickly I got involved in the so-called demo scene (a sub culture for showing off your artistic and programming skills) and started to create so-called computer demos with my team, competing against others teams at demo parties. Our team consisted of people from all over Sweden, and even other countries. In retrospect I realise that, as young teenagers we were working on projects together in self-organising distributed teams. We were using the ways of remote communication available at the time, which was the telephone, letters with floppies and sometimes modems. All of this gave me some really valuable lessons that proved to be essential throughout my work life. What happened to the demo scene and the team? Well, we are still doing things together, on Commodore 64, Amiga and other retro platforms, going to demo parties and competing with other teams.\nWorking with software engineering gives me a perfect mix of creativity and structure. The feeling when you create something of value with your team, or solve a complex problem together is awesome. I believe strongly in the ability of people working together in a playful manner, to make bits and bytes come to life.
